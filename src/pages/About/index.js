              Hey! my name is Jos√© and I am a front-end developer and web
              designer. I graduated from several courses at Udemy, FreeCodeCamp
              and EscuelaDevRock in the field of Web Development. At the moment
              I keep studying and diving deeper into these disciplines on my
              own.

              I believe that the most important thing in life is to find
              yourself and what you like. I am very glad that I have chosen this
              path, which is a straight line to success if you put the necessary
              effort and never give up. This motivates me and so I move on.
